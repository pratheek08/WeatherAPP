# WeatherAPP
#PRATHEEK UB
I have developed a weather applications using React and Django where it allow users to search for the weather conditions in a specific location.
Users are able to see the minimum, maximum, average temperature, and humidity for a given city and period of time.

Make sure you have Node and NPM [installed property](https://nodejs.org)
We require 2 packages for days forecast(accordion) and for react select wrapper lib

****In terminal
$ npm i react-accessible-accordion
$ npm i react-select-async-paginate --force
$ npm run start

****API KEYS used
