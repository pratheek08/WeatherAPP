# WeatherAPP
#PRATHEEK UB
I have developed a weather applications using React and Django where it allow users to search for the weather conditions in a specific location.
Users are able to see the minimum, maximum, average temperature, and humidity for a given city and period of time.

Make sure you have Node and NPM [installed property](https://nodejs.org)
We require 2 packages for days forecast(accordion) and for react select wrapper lib

****In terminal
$ `npm i react-accessible-accordion`
$ `npm i react-select-async-paginate --force`
$ `npm run start`
 
# Create React App
In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
